		<title>Performance</title>
	</header> 
	<body>
		<p>The following graphs compare the performance of a single database accessed via normal JDBC vs. a cluster of two identical databases accessed via HA-JDBC.</p>
		<section>
			<title>Read Operations</title>
			<p>
				By distributing read operations to each node in the cluster, HA-JDBC is able to achieve better performance under load than normal JDBC access.

		<section>
			<title>Write Operations</title>
			<p>
				By performing write operations in parallel to each node in the cluster, HA-JDBC is only slightly slower than normal JDBC access.
				The slight performance loss is largely due increased network traffic and parallel processing overhead.
