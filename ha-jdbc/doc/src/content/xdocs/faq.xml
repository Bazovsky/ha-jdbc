		<faq>
			<question>What does "distributable" feature do? and when would I need it?</question>
			<answer>
				By indicated the "distributable" option, you are declaring that your database cluster(s) will be accessed by multiple JVMs (e.g. cluster of application servers).
				HA-JDBC uses reliable multicast communication provided by JGroups to broadcast database activations and deactivations to each JVM.
				If your database cluster is accessed by more than one JVM and the "distributable" option is not specified, you run the risk of databases falling out of sync when a database is re-activated.

		<title>Using HA-JDBC</title>
		<faq>
			<question>When using the "distributable" feature, I get a <code>ChannelException</code>: "unable to set up the protocol stack".</question>
			<answer>
				The JGroups protocol stack should be setup according to the reliability afforded by the features on your network.
				Refer to the JGroups protocol documentation (http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/user/node134.html) for more specifics.
